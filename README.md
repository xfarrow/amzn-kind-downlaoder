When you buy a book, may also it be digital, you should have all the rights to personally own that book. This software helps you download purchased books from big A.


## How it works
It takes automatic screenshots of the book and merges them into a single PDF file. In the future I'd like to use an OCR library not to lose quality during the process.

It seems very difficult to directly retrieve text from the website; it's not HTML nor JS generated.
