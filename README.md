When you buy a book, may also it be digital, you should have all the rights to personally own that book. This software helps you download purchased books from big A (www.read.****.com)

## How it works
It takes automatic screenshots of the book and merges them into a single PDF file. Don't worry, you can minimize the window while the program does what it has to do.

It seems very difficult to directly retrieve text from the website; it's not HTML nor JS generated. 

## Tutorial

1. It is needed to have a cookie editor, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/">this</a> is the one I tried
2. Go to the URL where you can read the book (something like https://read.******.com/?asin=xxxx)
3. Export the cookies in the JSON format and give them to amzn-kind-downloader
4. Paste the link of the book in amzn-kind-downloader
5. Enjoy
