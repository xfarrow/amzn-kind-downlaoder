When you buy a book, may also it be digital, you should have all the rights to personally own that book. This software helps you to download purchased books from big A.


## How it works
It takes automatic screenshots of the book and merges them into a single PDF file. In the future I'd like to use an OCR library not to lose quality during the process.

It seems very difficult to directly retrieve text from the website; it's not HTML nor JS generated. 

## Note
This software is provided as is and neither the author (or authors) nor GitHub, Inc. are responsable or encourage misconduct, copyright violations and piracy.
The software does not contain any hardwired string referencing any website because you should run it only on websites you own or you have the authorization to access.

The acronym 'amzn' stands for 'athletic moms zumba noobs" of course.
